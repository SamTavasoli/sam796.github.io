    <h2>Object methods, "this"</h2>
    <p>
        To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.<br>
        The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.<br>
        Technically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the outer variable too. <br>
        but such code is unreliable. if we decide to copy our outer variable to another varialbe. If we do, then it will <br>
        access the wrong object.<br>
        In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if <br>
        it’s not a method of an object.<br>
        The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.<br>
        Arrow function has no "this"<br>
        Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Summary of Chapter 'Object methods, "this"'</h4>
    <p>The value of this is defined at run-time.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
        <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
        <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
        <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.</li>
        <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
        <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <p>
        Everything in JavaScript is either one of the six primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null) or an object.<br>
        In this chapter we study:<br>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Object literals</li>
            <li>Adding properties to objects</li>
            <li>Object methods</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>The Math object</li>
            <li>The Date object</li>
            <li>The RegExp object</li>
        </ol>
        Creating oject:<br>
        To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. <br>
        It’s also possible to create an object using a constructor function. <br>
        We can access the properties of an object using the dot notation that we’ve already seen in previous chapters.<br>
        This will return the value of that property,
        We can also access an object’s properties using bracket notation ― the property is represented by a string<br>
        inside square brackets, so needs to be placed inside single or double quotation marks:
        <uL>
            <li>Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces.</li>
            <li>Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as a method.</li>
            <li>An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.</li>
            <li>Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.</li>
            <li>Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.</li>
            <li>Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.</li>
            <li>JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.</li>
            <li>The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.</li>
            <li>The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.</li>
            <li>The Date object can be used to create date objects.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.</li>
            <li>The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.</li>
        </uL>
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 6: Document Oject Model</h2>
    <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page<br>
         by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.
         <ul>
             <li>The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.</li>
             <li>The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and 
                 document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.</li>
             <li>The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children()methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.</li>
             <li>An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute()method.</li>
             <li>The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.</li>
             <li>Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.</li>
             <li>Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.</li>
             <li>The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</li>
             <li>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</li>
         </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Chpater 7:Events</h2>
    <p>
        Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such<br>
        as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.
        <ul>
            <li>Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</li>
            <li>An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</li>
            <li>The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.</li>
            <li>There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events</li>
            <li>You can remove an event using theremoveEventListenermethod.</li>
            <li>The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function</li>
            <li>Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</li>
            <li>Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
