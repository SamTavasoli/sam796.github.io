    <h5>The Window Object</h5>
    <p>
        Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope<br>
        are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment<br>
        the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.<br>
        In this chapter we study about:<br>
        1- The Browser Object Model<br>
        2- Finding out browser information<br>
        3- Browser history<br>
        4- Controlling windows<br>
        5- Cookies<br>
        6- Timing functions<br>

        <ol>
            <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
            <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
            <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
            <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable</li>
            <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
            <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
            <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
            <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
            <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
            <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
            <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
            <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.</li>
            <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics<br>
                 capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        </ol>

    <h5>HTML5 APIs</h5>

    <p>
        HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. The latest iteration is HTML 5.1,<br>
        which finally became a W3C recommendation in November 2016.<br>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies,S<br>
                including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>
            <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>
            <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
            <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>
            <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>
            <li>The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control<br>
                the playback using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>
