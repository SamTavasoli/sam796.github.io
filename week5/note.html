    <h3 id="h3w5">Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <p>Summary of my study in Week 5</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I believe testing and debugging is one of the most importnat skill in writng code</li>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
        <li> In chapter 10, I read and learned about these topics:
            <ol>
                <li>Errors, exceptions, and warnings</li>
                <li>The importance of testing and debugging</li>
                <li>Strict mode</li>
                <li>Debugging in the browser</li>
                <li>Error objects</li>
                <li>Throwing exceptions</li>
                <li>Exception handling</li>
                <li>Testing frameworks</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Errors</h4>
    <p>When we encounter with error, it can be because of three reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>System error: problem with the system or external devices </li>
        <li>Programmer error: incorrect syntax or faulty logic</li>
        <li>User error: the user has entered data incorrectly</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.<br>
    An exception will produce stack trace too.<br>
    A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.<br>
    In stack trace, we work backwards to see that the error has been caused by what in the first place.  </p>
    <h4>Warnings</h4>
    <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
       Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in various environments.<br>
       Some browsers will show a small icon in the corner of the browser window to indicate that an exception or warning has occurred. <br>
       Others require the console to be open to see any warnings or exceptions.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing code in strict mode can improve its clarity and speed.<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/10/k01nwuu2?fromShare=true">use strict</a></li>
        <li>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file.</li>
        <li>In ES6, we don't need to declare 'use strict', it's a self-contained peice by default</li>
        <li>Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. </li>
        <li>Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programmingstyle guide</li>
        <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Debugging</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Tusty alert</strong> The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog<br>
        at certain points in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Using Console</strong> Most modern JavaScript environments have aconsoleobject that provides a number of<br>
         methods for logging information and debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the browsers also have a debugging tool that allow us to set breakpoints in our cod ethat will pauseit at certain points.<br>
        Then we can see the values and modify them.
    </p>
    <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of<br>
       the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.

    </p>
    <p>
        Erro objects can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code<br>
        using a constructor function. we have severn more erro objects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility</li>
        <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
        <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist.</li>
        <li>SyntaxError</li>
        <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used.</li>
        <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI</li>
        <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
    <p>
        we can use "try", and "catch" to handle the exceptions. The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception<br>
        is thrown inside the try block. The error object is automatically passed as a parameter to the catch block. This allows<br>
        us to query the error name, message and stack properties, and deal with it appropriately. In this case, we actually<br>
        return a string representation of an imaginary number:
    </p>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.</li>
        <li>Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What is Jest?<br>
        Jestis a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to createS<br>
        and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.<br>
        In order to use Jest, first we need to install it by using:<br>
        npm install -g jest<br>
    </p>
