    <h5>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h5>
    <p>
        - The CSS3 transform property lets you lets us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.<br>
        - Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the<br>
        behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right<br>
        along the x and y axes.<br>
        - The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.<br>
        - The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one<br>
        value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element<br>
        while maintaining the original aspect ratio.<br>
        - The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.<br>
        - The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.<br>
        - The steps to create a simple Transition using only CSS:
         <ol>
             <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
             <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
             <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition<br>
                 properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function,<br>
                 and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
         </ol>
         - To support older WebKit browsers, we need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties.<br>
         - The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take.<br>
         - If we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can use multiple transitions.<br>
         - CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow us to control each step of an animation via keyframes.       
    </p>

    <h5>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h5>

    <p>
        - With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.<br>
        - The Canvas API is supported
    </p>

        <li> In chapter 11 and 13, I read and learned about these topics about functions & Ajax

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
    <p>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves. </p>
    <h4>Call and Apply Methods</h4>
    <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the
        first argument.</p>
    <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
    <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the
        name suggests<br>
        , is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
        definition <br>
        (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which
        is done by placing<br>
        the whole declaration inside parentheses</p>

    <h4>Temporary variables</h4>
    <p><a
            href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwuzy?fromShare=true">Temporary
            Varialbes example</a></p>

    <h4>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks</h4>
    <p>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any
        other part of the program. Using IIFEs<br>
        in this way means code can be added or removed separately. </p>

    <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
    <p>The fact that functions rties and methods themselves. </p>

    <h4>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h4>
    <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and
        even redefine itself.<br>
        This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>

    <h4>Recursive Functions</h4>
    <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool <br>
        to use when iterative processes are involved. we can this its usage in foctorial of a number</p>

    <h4>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</h4>
    <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. JavaScript is a<br>
        single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time.<br>
        This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that the<br>
        program continues to run. Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created<br>
        that’s invoked when the event happens. This means that the code is able to run out of order,<br>
        or asynchronously</p>

    <h4>Creating A Promise</h4>
    <p>A promise is created using a constructor function. This takes a function called an executor as<br>
        an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation. It also<br>
        accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is <br>
        successful, and the reject() function is called if the operation fails. </p>

    <h4>Chaining Multiple Promises</h4>
    Promises come into their own when multiple asynchronous tasks are required to be carried out one after<br>
    the other. If each function that performs an asynchronous operation returns a promise, we can chain the<br>
    then() methods together to form a sequential piece of code that’s easy to read. Each promise will only<br>
    begin once the previous promise has been settled.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
        <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>
        <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the<br>
            next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
        <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no <br>
            side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency).</li>
        <li>Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function.<br>
            A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ajax</h3>
    <p>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clients and server</li>
        <li>A brief history of Ajax</li>
        <li>Communicating with the server using the Fetch API</li>
        <li>Receiving data with Ajax</li>
        <li>Receiving data with Ajax</li>
        <li>Sending data with Ajax</li>
        <li>Form data</li>
        <li>Our project ― obtain questions using Ajax</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The Fetch API</h4>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method<br>
        that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.
        <a
            href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/13/k01nwvlv?fromShare=true">Example</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Response Interface</h4>
    <p>The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is
        fulfilled. Response objects<br>
        have a number of properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The data normally have beeb send by JSON</li>
        <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload</li>
        <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs and can be made by using the Fetch APIs.</li>
        <li>The Response interface can allows us to control the response received from a request or to create our<br>
            own response objects and it can allows us to create a request object that contains information about<br>
            the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
    </ul>
