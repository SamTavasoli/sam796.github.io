    <h5>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h5>
    <p>
        - The CSS3 transform property lets you lets us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.<br>
        - Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the<br>
        behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right<br>
        along the x and y axes.<br>
        - The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.<br>
        - The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one<br>
        value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element<br>
        while maintaining the original aspect ratio.<br>
        - The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.<br>
        - The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.<br>
        - The steps to create a simple Transition using only CSS:
         <ol>
             <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
             <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
             <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition<br>
                 properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function,<br>
                 and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
         </ol>
         - To support older WebKit browsers, we need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties.<br>
         - The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take.<br>
         - If we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can use multiple transitions.<br>
         - CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow us to control each step of an animation via keyframes.       
    </p>

    <h5>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h5>

    <p>
        - With HTML5’s Canvas API, we are able to draw what we can imagine, all through JavaScript.<br>
        - The Canvas API is supported in: Chormoe 4+, Firefox2+, Opera9.6+, Safari3.1+, iOS3.2+, Interner Explorer 9.0+, Android3.0+<br>
        - All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API<br>
        - We can draw shpapes by creating paths. Paths create a blueprint for our line, arcs, and shapes. but paths are invisible until we give them a stroke.<br>
        - Saving Canvas Drawing: If we create an image programmatically using the Canvas API, but decide <br>
        we’d like to have a local copy of our drawing, we can use the API’s toDataURL method to save our drawing.<br>
        toDataURL creates a URL with the image in it, (either a png or jpg, whichever is specified). You can<br>
        then right-click the image at this URL, and save it as a PNG or JPEG.
        - SVG: a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML<br>
        - We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including drawing<br>
        paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.
        - Raphaël is an open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and animating with SVG much easier.
        - Both canvas and SVG allow you to draw custom shapes, paths, and fonts, but 
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, as we saw when we turned our video from color to black and white.</li>
            <li>One downside of canvas is that it operates in what’s known as immediate mode. This means that if you ever<br>
                want to add more to the canvas, you’re unable to simply add to what’s already there.</li>
            <li>Every time you finish drawing a shape, the canvas no longer has access to that shape,</li>
            <li>There’s also no access to what’s drawn on the canvas via the DOM</li>
            <li>Canvas is much faster than SVG </li>
            <li>Canvas is generally the better choice if you’re looking to design a game requiring lots of animations.</li>
        </ul>
        In summary, if you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns about the ability to retrieve and<br>
        modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice. If, on the other hand, you need to be able to access<br>
        and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG might be more appropriate.<br>
        - we need several steps to add drag and drop to our page:
        <ul>
            <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements we’d like to be draggable.</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that we want to have accept dropped items.</li>
        </ul>
        - In order to make the elements draggable we add the draggable attribute to them and set the value to true.<br>
    </p>
