        Summary of my study in Week 4
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods</li>
        <li> I learned more about three concept:
            <ol>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
        <li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use theclasskeyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.</li>
        <li>An alternative way to create objects is to use aconstructor function</li>
        <li>The keyword "this" is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function</li>
        <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.</li>
        <li>The names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized</li>
        <li>All objects have aconstructorproperty that returns the constructor function that created it</li>
        <li>The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method</li>
        <li>Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a classâ€™s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class</li>
        <li>All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object</li>
        <li>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared</li>
        <li>Public & Private methods</li>
        <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>
        <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.</li>
        <li>A class can inherit from another class using the "extends" keyword in a class declaration.</li>
        <li>The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in different ways</li>
        <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
        <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
